This project creates linear regression models to predict life expectancy from population-level data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) checks for errors and creates graphs to understand the relationships between variables.
Feature engineering is a function which transforms variables in the data to be suitable for linear regression.
There are two linear regression models, one which takes general population-level data and a second model which excludes medically sensitive information, for privacy-sensitive users.
These linear regression models are then combined in a function, which prompts the user for which model they would like to use and inputs to make a prediction about the life-expectancy of a population.
